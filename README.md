# A study on Spending Pattern of Mumbaikars

The study aims to analyze consumers' spending patterns and understand the current and future purchasing behaviours in specific product or service categories. Demographic factors like age, income, and region influence spending patterns, and the survey also examines the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on consumer spending. The objectives include studying expenditure on needs and wants, exploring avenues of savings and investments, identifying demographic factors affecting spending, and analyzing the pandemic's economic impact on the target group.

## Objectives:
- Primary data was collected through a survey
- Statistical techniques and data visualizations were used to make inferences.

## Outcome:
This study examined spending and saving patterns of Mumbai residents. The average Mumbaikar follows a 50/20/30 budget rule, allocating 50% to essentials, 23% to non-essentials, and saving/investing 27%. Age influences spending behavior, with younger individuals having minimal expenses, those aged 31-45 facing higher expenses than earnings, and those aged 46-60 focusing on saving. Earnings impact saving and investing choices, with gender and income also playing a role. Males tend to save more, and respondents prioritize saving even after a raise while cutting expenses during pay cuts. Overall, the respondents patterns showed prudent financial behavior and decent financial literacy.
